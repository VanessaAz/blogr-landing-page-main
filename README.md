# Frontend Mentor - Blogr landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Blogr landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blogr-landing-page-EX2RLAApP). Frontend Mentor challenges help me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects. 


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript (manipulation DOM elements, style)

### What I learned

- Object-position + Object-fit
- Use background-image + color
